				Graphs are ubiquitous in many applications, such as molecular biochemistry, neural science, Internet, computer vision, NLP, and crowdsourcing.	
				Machine learning on graphs, especially with neural networks, has demonstrated prediction accuracy. However, accuracy is not the only desideratum,
				and humans and society can still be negatively impacted by the models if care is not taken. For example, a model can lack of transparency so that it is hard to understand why a model make a prediction;
				a model's accuracy may drop due to slight perturbations;
				or an accurate model can treat different demographical groups or individuals in an unfair way.
				We aim to make the models more responsible by investigating explainability, fairness, and robustness beyond accuracy of the models.
			       	(i) On large graphs, power-law degree distributions are common and can lead to fairness issues in the graphical models and affect end-users.
			        We propose a linear system to certificate if multiple desired fairness criteria can be fulfilled simultaneously, and if not,
				a multi-objective optimization algorithm to find Pareto fronts for efficient trade-offs among the criteria 
				[<a href='publications.html#cikm2021'>CIKM2021</a>]).
				To reduce optimization cost, the team proposes continuous Pareto front exploration
				by exploiting the smoothness of the set of Pareto optima.
				As graphs can contain hidden factors to complicate fairness issues,
				we simultaneously learn a fair models and identify such hidden factors to mitigate the issues
				[<a href='publications.html#kdd2023ws_2'>KDD2023</a>]),
				(ii) Graphical models can be hard to understand by human users due to multiplexed information propagations over many edges.
				The team published a series of works addressing challenges in making graphical models more interpretable,
				such as
				large discrete search space
				[<a href='publications.html#icdm2019'>ICDM2019</a>]),
				axiomatic attribution
				[<a href='publications.html#cikm2020'>CIKM2020</a>]),
				multi-objective explanations
				[<a href='publications.html#icdm2021_a'>ICDM2021a</a>]).
				Lastly, robustness can be interpreted broadly as maintaining any desired properties under reasonably slight perturbations.
				We study robustness of explanations through the tools of constrained optimization
				[<a href='publications.html#icdm2021_b'>ICDM2021b</a>])
				robust optimization, statistical theory, and optimization convergence analysis

				Online contents hosted on Twitter (now X), Yelp, Amazon, etc. are full of opinionated information that can significantly influence audience's decision making.
				For example, during the COVID pandemic, information about vaccines can significantly influence the rate of vaccinations; dishonest entities have adopted unethical or even illegal strategies by paying spammers to post fake reviews (opinion spams) to promote or demote the targets businesses and producs.
				Such activities lead to trust crisis of the online contents.
				To address the issue, misinformation detection is necessary.

				An ensemble of multiple models, if fused properly, can provide more predictive power than any constituent model.
				Traditional ensemble methods, with a long history, studied the fusion of a small number of predictive models for binary and multi-class prediction.
				We move this field forward by targeting at fusing many unidentifiable predictive models,
				such as crowdsourcing workers,
				with sparse and structured output such as sets, rankings, and trees.
				The challenges are to gauge the individual model's performance
				and to take into account the extra knowledge of the output space. Please check
				out these three papers

				Multi-labeled learning is a technique to assign more than one semantic concepts to a data item and has found wide applications in areas
				such as bioinformatics, healthcare, e-commerce, and social media.
				Big data have changed the landscape of multi-labeled learning by increasing the number of labels to an unprecedented scale.
			       	For example, there are tens of thousands of tags (as labels) for texts
				on Stackoverflow and Yahoo Answer, and
				millions of tags for images on Flickr.
				Extreme multi-labeled learning tries to scale up the traditional multi-labeled learning
				to handle the large number of labels with varying importance, sparsity, and informativeness.
				My current research tries to address the scalability challenges in many aspects
				through the help of NLP, knowledgebases, and crowdsourcing. See
